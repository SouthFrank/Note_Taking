- The Link. [[General]].
- The tag. #content
- Italics. As you're typing and you want to *emphasize* something you add asterisks.
- Bold. Typically, I'll use this when I want to bring attention to **Big Nouns**.
- Lists. Hyphens for bulleted lists. Number and period for numbered lists. - or 1. 2. 3. 
- Headers. # followed by a spacebar. There are 6 levels to this, determined by how many hashes you use.
