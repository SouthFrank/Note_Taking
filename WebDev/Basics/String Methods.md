Strings provide a lot of helper methods, see [MDN Docs on String Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods) for a full list.

Strings are immutable in JavaScript. So a "modification", e.g. by some of the methods above, will always create a new string instead.

- `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase` - change the case of all characters
- `trim` - removes whitespace at the beginning and end
- `includes` 
- `startsWith`
- `endsWith`
- `slice` - extract a section of the string
