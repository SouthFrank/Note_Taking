Map has higher performance and require less code to write, giving them an advantage over Object.

The following are some cases where you can use Map:

- If you want to use complex data types as keys.
- If preserving the insertion order of your keys is required.
- When performing hashing.

However, some cases necessitate the use of an Object. The following are some of them:

- Object is ideal for cases where we need a simple structure to hold data and the keys are either strings or symbols.
- Object is unquestionably the best option in scenarios where different logic must be applied to each property piece.
- When dealing with JSON data, Object have direct support in JSON, but Map do not.
