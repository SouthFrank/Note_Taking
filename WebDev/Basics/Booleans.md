A boolean data type represents one of two values: true or false. Boolean value is either true or false. Any comparison operator returns a boolean value. Examples:

### Truthy and Falsy

#### Truthy values
- All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
- Al strings are truthy except an empty string ("")
- The boolean true

#### Falsy values
- 0
- 0n
- null
- undefined
- NaN
- the boolean false
- '', "", `` empty string

**Undefined**
If we declared a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. In addition to this, if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.

**Arithmetic Operators**
Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponential

**Comparison Operators**
In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to another value:

**Logical Operators**
The following symbols are the common logical operators: &&(ampersand), ||(pipe) and !(negation). The && operators gets true only if the two operands are true. The || operator gets true if either operand is true. The ! operator negates true to false and false to true.

**Increment Operator**
In JavaScript, we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment can be pre or post increment. Let's see each:

**Decrement Operator**
In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post decrement. Let's see each:

**Ternary Operators**
Ternary operators allows you to write a condition. Look at the following examples:
