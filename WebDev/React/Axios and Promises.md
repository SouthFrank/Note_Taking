Axios is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

The documentation from Mozilla states the following about promises:
> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

A promise can have three distinct states:
1. Pending: it means that the final value (one of the following two) is note available yet.
2. Fulfilled/resolved: it means that the operation has been completed and the final value is available, which generally is a successful operation. 
3. Rejected: it means that an error prevented the final value from being determined, which generally represents a failed operation.
