#### Module Bundlers
- Browserify - released in 2011 and pioneered the usage of node.js style require statements on the frontend (which is essentially what enabled npm to become the frontend package manager of choice).
- Webpack - around 2015, [[webpack]] eventually became the more widely used module bundler (fueled by the popularity of the [[React]] frontend framework, which took full advantage of the webpack's various features).
	- Can handle not only JS, but also other assets like CSS, images, and more. Powerful and flexible configuration system.
- Parcel - A zero-configuration bundler that simplifies the process of setting up and using a bundler. It supports various types of assets out of the box and requires minimal configuration.
- Rollup - Known for its focus on creating smaller, more efficient bundles. Rollup is often used for libraries and packages that are intended to be distributed for consumption by other developers.
